# auto-binding-visualizer
Automatic Molecular Visualization of Binding Sites
An interactive Python tool to visualize the binding site of a protein-ligand complex given its PDB ID. The tool should display and label interacting residues and ligand interactions.
Tools and Libraries
Python
PDB: Protein Data Bank files for molecular structures.
Molviz Tools:
MDAnalysis: For processing molecular dynamics trajectories and PDB files.
NGLView: For 3D visualization of molecular structures.
ProLIF (Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints): For analyzing protein-ligand interactions.
